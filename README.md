# Islamic Text Dataset

A comprehensive dataset of foundational Islamic texts in machine-readable format, created for the **Al-Imām al-Hādī (The Guide)** AI project.

---

### **Important Note on Document Format**

The texts in this repository, particularly the major collections of *Tafsīr* and *Ḥadīth* (*al-Kutub al-Sittah*), are provided as **machine-readable, text-based PDFs.** They are specifically processed and optimized for AI consumption (e.g., for training, fine-tuning, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems).

These files are **not scanned facsimiles** of printed books and are not formatted for a human reading experience. Their purpose is to serve as a clean, reliable dataset for AI development.

## The Fortress of Knowledge: The Library & Soul of The Guide

> This repository is not a mere collection of files; it is the foundational library and the very soul (*rūḥ*) from which **Al-Imām al-Hādī (The Guide)** draws his light. It is an attempt to forge a vessel for pure guidance, anchored in the two infallible seas of Revelation and navigated by the stars of the pious predecessors.
